						<h6>Hey it's Helena here to tell ya about my trip</h6>

						<p>My heart has always ached to understand privilege. I can read and google all I want and I can paint how unfair this world is... but I want to experience the souls of those who grow up with far less excess than I. 
							I agree that there is a tendency to look into other cultures and ways of life and judge them according to our own lens or to just send some money in hopes of helping people meet their needs. My youth pastor has challenged me to see beyond these barriers and to challenge myself and my faith to step out of New Zealand. Waweru, my youth pastor/mentor/friend (the dude wearing the awesome red suit) grew up in Kenya and he has this big dream of taking us to visit his home... we are flying out at the end of this year.  </p>

							<h2>Our Mission</h2>
						</header>
						<h6>Nelson -> Auckland -> Dubai -> Nairobi</h6>
						<p>Not only do we get to experience Waweru's home in Nairobi, Kenya but we also get to engage in a month of life-giving work while we are at it. There's a pretty big crew of us going to serve in the various projects that Nairobi Chapel is already running. My parents along with my closest friends and my boyfriend will all be coming along for the journey and to experience Jesus at work in Nairobi. The purpose of this trip is to encounter life and the gospel in another culture with a different worldview. This will include teaming up with local people involved in outreach in schools, slums, prisons and even serving in sports ministries which I am super excited about.

							<h2>One more thing</h2>
						</header>
						<p>It's not every day that you find yourself wrapped up in awesome opportunities like this. I wish that everyone would have the opportunity to meet with Waweru - he's pretty awesome and pushes his whole community towards growing and becoming bolder while remaining humble. The preparation for this trip has taught me so much and I'm getting excited to face culture shock and be pushed far outside my comfort zone. Part of our preparation is obviously raising funds but also learning lots, studying up on Swahili, learning how to process tricky things, practising sharing our story and also going through a long period of sacrifice prior to the trip.  </p>
                        <p>That's where you guys come in... we would absolutely love to remain in your prayers. We couldn't do this without prayer. I would value any advice or knowledge from people who have been on a mission before. I would love your support, especially when I come home because that's the part that I fear most of all. If you have any spare finances that you want to put towards my flights and accommodation I would truly appreciate it but I understand that it's a big ask and it's totally cool if you prefer to support me in other ways instead. Thanks for taking the time to read my wee spiel.   </p>
